Test Kitchen
--------------

### Install Deps

```
$ bundle
```

### VMs

This kitchen configuration comes with different VMs:

* centos6
* centos7
* trusty (Ubuntu-14.04)
* xenial (Ubuntu-16.04)
* jessie (Debian-8)

If you want to test the role using all of those machines, just run the commands below as they are. If you want to test the role on one system only, append to the commands below the VM name.

e.g.

```
$ bundle exec kitchen converge centos7
```

To converge the `centos7` VM only.

### Create the VM

```
$ bundle exec kitchen create
```

### Converge your role

```
$ bundle exec kitchen converge
```

### Run serverspec tests

```
$ bundle exec kitchen verify
```

**NB**: To run `verify` the VM must be converged first.

### Destroy the VM

```
$ bundle exec kitchen destroy
```

### Run Create/Converge/Verify/Destroy in one command

```
$ bundle exec kitchen test
```

### Write your tests

You can write your own test by adding a new file or editing the existing one living in the `test/integration/aws/serverspec/localhost` directory. More info about how to write serverspec test can be found [here](http://serverspec.org/).
